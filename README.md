# Common Scripts

This is a compilation of scripts that can be used for automating common dev tasks. From setting up a fresh Wordpress site with all of the common plugins, to deploying a site to production with production values and CD setup.

It's ok if you use different config or want different plugins - feel free to fork this repo and make them your own. We hope you'll benefit from our templates.
